### Project Summary
**DataSet**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata
**Project Name: Movie Recommender System**

This project is a movie recommendation application that leverages the TMDB (The Movie Database) dataset to suggest movies based on user preferences. The system processes movie data, including genres, keywords, cast, and crew, to create a comprehensive tagging system for each film. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, particularly Count Vectorization, to compute the similarity between movies using cosine similarity. The application features a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit, where users can input their favorite movie and receive tailored recommendations, complete with movie posters fetched from the TMDB API. 

1. **Developed a Movie Recommender System**: Designed and implemented a movie recommendation application using machine learning techniques, enhancing user experience through personalized suggestions.

2. **Data Processing and Feature Engineering**: Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy to clean, preprocess, and transform raw movie dataset into meaningful features for analysis, achieving a structured dataset ready for modeling.

3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques**: Applied Count Vectorization to convert text data into numerical format, enabling the computation of cosine similarity for accurate movie recommendations.

4. **Streamlit Application Development**: Created an interactive user interface with Streamlit, allowing users to search and receive personalized movie recommendations alongside relevant visual content, improving engagement and accessibility.
